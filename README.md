# Ubiquiti Front-End Test Assignment

This single page app is to complete Ubiquiti's front-end developer test assignment.

## How to Use

Go to https://www.iancomposer.com/ubiquiti/

The app displays products in list view by default. You can use the tools in the upper-right
hand corner to change to grid view and filter results by product line.

The left side of the toolbar contains a search input for further narrowing results.

Click on a device listing to find additional information about that product.

The app is fully responsive to screen size feel free to try it out on a phone or
tablet, as well.

Have fun and thank you for checking out my work!
